# animation-replacer-roblox (automatic animation spoofer)


## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:
```bash
    cargo build
```

## Description
The goal of the bot is to scrape roblox files and republish any animations to make them work when you pubish the game.
This bot will spoof every animation automatically and won't need any help from the user besides getting their cookie.

## Disclaimer
This is my first real rust project. Besides python and golang im a total noob in rust.
